For this data analysis project, I utilized several tools and technologies including Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Plotly to extract insights from YouTube comments. The main focus of the project was to perform sentiment analysis using the TextBlob module and visualize the results using the WordCloud module.

Using the TextBlob module, I analyzed the sentiment of the YouTube comments and found that most comments fell into the neutral sentiment category, while a smaller percentage was classified as either positive or negative. To visualize the most commonly used positive and negative keywords in the comments, I used the WordCloud module. This helped me to identify the most frequently used words in the comments and understand the general tone of the comments.

Additionally, I analyzed the frequency of commonly used emojis in the comments and found that the laughing face emoji was the most frequently used. This gave me an idea of the emotions of the viewers and helped me to understand how they were reacting to the videos.

Furthermore, I analyzed the relationship between views, likes, and dislikes of videos on YouTube and found that videos in the music, comedy, and entertainment categories received the highest number of likes. This information can be useful for content creators who want to create videos that are likely to receive more likes.

Another aspect of the project was to analyze the largest trending channels on YouTube. I found that [insert channel name] had the largest number of trending videos during the time of the analysis. This information can be useful for businesses or individuals who are interested in advertising on YouTube or collaborating with popular channels.

Overall, this project helped me to develop my skills in data analysis, Python programming, sentiment analysis, and data visualization. It also gave me a deeper understanding of the factors that contribute to the success of YouTube videos and channels. The code and findings from this project have been shared on GitHub, making it a valuable resource for others who are interested in analyzing YouTube comments and improving their data analysis skills.
